    poem: "After all, there’s no need\nto say anything\n\nat first. An orange, peeled\nand quartered, flares\n\nlike a tulip on a wedgewood plate\nAnything can happen.\n\nOutside the sun\nhas rolled up her rugs\n\nand night strewn salt\nacross the sky. My heart\n\nis humming a tune\nI haven’t heard in years!\n\nQuiet’s cool flesh—\nlet’s sniff and eat it.\n\nThere are ways\nto make of the moment\n\na topiary\nso the pleasure’s in\n\nwalking through.",

    poem: "How do we come to be here next to each other   \nin the night\nWhere are the stars that show us to our love   \ninevitable\nOutside the leaves flame usual in darkness   \nand the rain\nfalls cool and blessed on the holy flesh   \nthe black men waiting on the corner for   \na womanly mirage\nI am amazed by peace\nIt is this possibility of you\nasleep\nand breathing in the quiet air",
